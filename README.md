# ProgressSoft-.NET-Task

Welcome to the ProgressSoft .NET Developer Task repository for the Apollo Team. 

This project utilizes ASP.NET Core Web API and Angular for creating a web application to manage business card information. Throughout this project, I have gained valuable experience in generating QR codes, handling CSV files, and improving my skills in Angular. I organized my time efficiently by dividing tasks on Trello :
